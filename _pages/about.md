About me
======
I am a 2nd-year CS PhD student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My research primarily focuses on the intersection of robust optimization and learning theory. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jelena Diakonikolas](https://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/). Additionally, I have the privilege of collaborating with Prof. [Ilias Diakonikolas](http://www.iliasdiakonikolas.org/) and other amazing collaborators. Prior to joining Madison, I completed my B.S. degree in Computer Science, Honors Mathematics and Honors Stastistics at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, where I was honored to be advised by Prof. [Ambuj Tewari](https://www.ambujtewari.com/) and Dr. [Yash Patel](https://ypatel.io/).
